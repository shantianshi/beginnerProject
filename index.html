    <p>Database management systems are systems that manage the full data structure and exercise full control over the data stored in an organization’s database. As compared to the traditional approaches of maintaining data in an organization, the modern system has a number of advantages. Organizational data is always susceptible to losses and therefore a proper system is highly recommended when a lot of data exists. The following are benefits of using database management systems in an organization.

            Data Sharing Is Improved In The Organization
            Proper database management systems help in gaining better access to data as well as better management of the data. In turn, better access helps the end users share the data fast and effectively across the organization.
            
            Improvement In Data Security
            A better framework is provided for enforcement of data privacy and security policies. The risks of data security breaches are minimized and corporate data is used properly.
            
            Effective Data Integration
            When data management is improved, it promotes an integrated picture of an organization’s operations. It becomes easy to see how operations in one segment of the organization affects other segments of the organization. Thus, effective integration of data is accomplished through the use of data management solutions.
            
            Database Management Systems Minimize Data Inconsistency
            Data inconsistency occurs when different versions of data exist in different places in an organization. By using a proper management system and data quality management tools, the problem of data inconsistency is minimized.
            
            Better Access To Data
            A management system helps in getting quick solutions to database queries, and therefore, data access is faster and more accurate. End users like sales people will have enhanced access to the data, enabling a faster sales cycle and a more sound decision making process.
            
            Increase In Productivity Of The End User
            By deploying the best data quality tools and database management systems, the productivity of the end user is increased. With the data management tools, the end users are empowered to make quick and informed decisions that can decide the success and failure of a company in a long run.
            
            Quick Decision Making
            When data is better managed and access is improved, quality information is generated and the user is enabled to make faster decisions. A good database managing system helps in providing a framework to facilitate data quality initiatives and in turn, higher quality information helps in making better, faster decisions in an organization.</p>
